# HateSpeechDetection
A series of models for different hate speech classification tasks.

SubtaskA is a binary classification for whether a tweet is considered hate speech or not. 
SubtaskB is a another binary classification looking into whether the hate speech is targeted or untargeted.
SubtaskC is a multiclass classification looking into whether the targeted hate speech is directed towards a group, an individual or other. 

Many different models have been implemented to solve these tasks, ranging from the logistic regression algorithm, to newer pretrained models like BERT and Flair.
Finally exploring the neural networks for NLP such as the LSTM and GRU architectures. 

This task was featured on the Semeval-2019/2020 task boards, so additional information about these tasks can be found in the link below.
